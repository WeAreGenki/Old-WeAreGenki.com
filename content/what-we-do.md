## Customer Experience <span class="initialism">(CX)</span>

**Customer Experience**: A customer experience is any point a customer interacts with a brand or service in any way (directly or indirectly) and how they perceive the experience relative to their expectations.

**CX Design**: We use customer experience design tools and techniques to discover exactly how customers are interacting with a business. We then devise a strategy for improving the customer experience in ways that will get maximum business results.

Some of the tools we use are:

+ Customer personas
+ Customer journey mapping
+ Customer behaviour research
+ Business intelligence analysis

## Next-gen Web Experiences

We work with conversion oriented web companies on implementing their CX focussed websites. We work on all types of web experiences, but we're really great at ecommerce.

### Magento Ecommerce Platform

Magento is our preferred platform for full-featured ecommerce implementations. It's an industry leading ecommerce platform well known for its enterprise-class features and customisability.

+ Powerful, stable, robust 
+ In-depth control over user experience
+ Integrates well with other business systems
+ Enterprise support available

#### Magento Themes

Magento allows for complete control over how things work and how they're presented. We make full use of this customisability in our own in-house developed themes.
