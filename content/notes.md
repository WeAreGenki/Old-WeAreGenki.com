## REDESIGN

+ [Ecommerce with a human touch]
+ ~~Remake website with a focus on just customer experience~~
    * ~~Ecommerce with focus on blended experience~~
    * REMAKE as a ecommerce network
        - Ref: http://www.envato.com
+ Rethink menu - ref: http://prty.jp/project.html?p=the-luxury-test
    * Home
    * Our sites - experiment with dedicated page vs on the homepage
        - Probably more towards the combined homepage with property listing because people wont understand otherwise
    * About us
    * The Experience
    * Work With Us / Careers
    * Community
    * Blog
    * Consulting & Workshops - maybe split into 2 pages/sections
    * Contact
        - Partnership requests/talking about
+ Rethink offerings
    * ~~CX [project overhaul/research package] - starting at $15000/month~~
    * Ecommerce and CX consulting, workshops - ~~move to MaxMilton.com~~ Keep here
        - Automation
    * Ecommerce content strategy
+ New process
    * Clear customer segmentation - customer personas - key first step in customer journey mapping, different customer segments make different journeys, this makes sure we're focusing on the right journey
    * Define customer goal
    * Customer journey mapping
    * Customer experience strategy development
        - Prioritise improvements
        - Focus on voice of the customer programs
        - Create offerings
        - Train employees
            * Non-verbals
    * Customer centric culture - customer journey thinking
    * Alternate/additional domains
        - genkicommerce.com - available
        - genkiretail.com - available
+ Ultra performance
    * JQuery free - still use smoothState.js (lead a project to remove jQuery dependency - see what particleground done) or find alternative (service worker + app shell?)
    * Focus on critical rendering path optimisations
        - Try critical CSS optimisations - try gulp-criticalcss
    * Big mobile optimisations
        - Responsive images - https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/delivering-responsibly.html
    * Also look into accessibility optimisation - would be a good case study for my portfolio
    * Do performance testing of self-hosted fonts
* Full HTTPS site - HTTP2
    - Also use PUSH - probably makes things faster than even http - send resources before the browser requests them (push theme.css, all.js, icons.woff2)
* Service workers & app shell (try experimentation)
    - https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell
    - https://www.code-labs.io/codelabs/sw-precache/#0
    - Actually NOT a good idea for small/static size, maybe worth it for Magento sites though
    - How could this work with smoothstate.js
* Look into using the Google AMP project as a base - https://www.ampproject.org/

Your customers are a lot more than just lines in a spreadsheet. They're people who are looking for the perfect solution to their needs.

"The impact that customer journey mapping can have for a business should not be underestimated. Customer journey maps provide the framework that enables a business to look at the holistic customer experience through one lens and create a customer-centric culture for change. Allowing everyone across the business to understand exactly what the 'as is' experience looks like today, establish how the journey should be re-designed in line with customer needs and their role in creating a superior customer experience."
